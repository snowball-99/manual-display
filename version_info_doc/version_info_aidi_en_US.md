## AIDI Update description

### 3.3.0 Version Update

**Algorithm Upgrade**

(1) Complex network added to detection algorithm

(2) Added geometric matching tool (Beta)

(3) Added EL unsupervised segmentation tool (Beta)

(4) All AI algorithm tools support 50 series graphics cards

**Software upgrade**

(1) Added intelligent annotation tool

(2) Added regional modeling tool to solve the problem of small batch multi-variety detection

(3) Views support fuzzy matching: add suffix filtering to views with the same name to support fuzzy matching

(4) When exporting data packages in any module, you can select the view of the input tool

(5) Hybrid graph engineering supports specifying subgraphs for training and reasoning

(6) Added feedback information tool: one-click generation of feedback information to facilitate analysis of on-site problems

**Optimization and usability improvement**

(1) Optimize the operation of projects with more than 10,000 images without lag

(2) The tools connected to the regional calculation and comprehensive judgment tools can be modified and reconnected

(3) Optimize the display effect of multiple screens with different sizes

(4) Optimize the graphics card configuration information to be user-related, and each user has independent configuration

(5) The views in the image list are displayed in the order of their positions in the original image

(6) Support the modification of inference parameters in factory mode

(7) The color of the defect mark point displayed after the image display area is reduced: green dots are annotations, and red dots are inference results

(8) Support direct opening of specified path projects and double-clicking to directly open a single project

(9) All contents exported to folders are no longer required to be empty folders, and users can choose to overwrite files with the same name

(10) Fixed several bugs
